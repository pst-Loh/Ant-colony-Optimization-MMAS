# Ant-colony-Optimization-MMAS
The Ant Colony Optimization is a probabilistic technique  and is solving combinatorial optimization and NP-Hard problems. The algorithm is based on the pheromone communication through trail laying of real ants and their behavior. 
The Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) is a special variant of the classical Ant Colony Optimization.The MMAS algorithm controls the quantity of pheromones which will be deposited on the paths. In this variant, the deposition of pheromones is only upgraded by the best generated solution. The algorithm also limits the amount of pheromones for deposition to prevent a deadlock and to improve explorational behavior of the MMAS algorithm (Dorigo and Stützle, 2010).
